# jmws_drupal_stark_idMyGadget-d8-second_try

Second attempt to write code to integrate idMyGadget [jmws_idMyGadget_for_drupal-d8](https://github.com/tomwhartung/jmws_idMyGadget_for_drupal-d8) with the default Drupal 8 theme Stark.

For some reason this theme does not allow blocks to be placed.

Worse than that, when I click on Save Blocks on this theme's Block Layout page, it removes all the blocks from bartik.  I mean wtf.

And curiously, when I use the same process to create a theme named idmygadget_stark (see the [jmws_drupal_idMyGadget_stark-d8](https://github.com/tomwhartung/jmws_drupal_idMyGadget_stark-d8) repo) it appears to work fine.
